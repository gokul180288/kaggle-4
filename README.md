## Welcome to my Kaggle GitHub Page
I created my Kaggle account in Apr 2015 but really started participating in competitions from November 2015. My first competition was predicting 'Rossmann Store Sales' that ran through mid-December 2015. I tried basic Classification algorithm for my first submission to that competition to verify my position in Public Leader Board. Then slowly accelerated to other types of models.

## Competitions Participated
* Rossmann Store Sales - Sales predicting competition. Competition status: **Closed.**
* Walmart Recruiting: Trip Type Classification - Classification of Customer Trip to Walmart stores. Competition status: **Closed.**
* The Winton Stock Market Challenge - Predicting intra and end of day stock returns future. Competition status: On-going.
* Prudential Life Insurance Assessment - Customer Risk classification on Life Insurance application. Competition status: On-going.
* Telstra Network Disruptions -  Predict the severity of service disruptions on the network. Competition status: On-going.

## Models used
Before participating in the above competitions, I analyzed the previous Kaggle competitions and user scripts. Predominantly, 'XGBoost' was used for single model submissions in both competitions. So I tried 'XGBoost' to start with and ensembles of XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Network, Classification, and GBM.

## Focus
Kaggle's recruiting competition prohibits participants to post their code in the forum and form a group or team. This helps each individual to exhibit their own idea and expertise in Data Science area - not hijacked by others idea. This really helps me evaluate where I stand, as an individual, when compared to other participants across the World.
