{"name":"Kaggle","tagline":"This repository contains my codes and scripts submitted to various Kaggle competitions that I participated.","body":"## Welcome to my Kaggle GitHub Page\r\nI created my Kaggle account in Apr 2015 but really started participating in competitions from November 2015. My first competition was predicting 'Rossmann Store Sales' that ran through mid-December 2015. My first submission to that competition on got errored out due to formatting issue. Then got hold of Sample submissions provided in the data set and it got accepted.\r\n\r\n## Competitions Participated\r\n* Rossmann Store Sales - Sales predicting competition. Competition status: Closed.\r\n* Walmart Recruiting: Trip Type Classification - Classification of Customer Trip to Walmart stores. Competition status: Closed.\r\n* The Winton Stock Market Challenge - Predicting intra and end of day stock returns future.

Competition status: On-going.\r\n\r\n## Models used\r\nBefore participating in the above competitions, I analyzed the previous Kaggle competitions and user scripts. Predominantly, 'XGBoost' was used for single model submissions in both competitions. So I tried 'XGBoost' to start with and ensembles of XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Network, Classification, and GBM.\r\n\r\n### Rossmann Store Sales\r\n1. Recursive Partition Classification Tree - [Link](https://github.com/socratesk/kaggle/blob/master/Rossmann/1-Classification.R)\r\n2. Random Forest - \r\n\r\n## Focus\r\nKaggle's recruiting competition prohibits participants to post their code in the forum and form a group or team. This helps each individual to exhibit their own idea and expertise in Data Science area - not hijacked by others idea. This really helps me evaluate where I stand, as an individual, when compared to other participants across the World. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
